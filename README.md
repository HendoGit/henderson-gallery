# henderson-gallery

A personal side-project to learn front-end fundamentals like webpack, managing DOM via vanilla JS, deploying via netlify etc... 

Demo site hosted at [henderson.gallery](https://henderson.gallery)

## Dev set-up

Simply `npm install` to install dependencies, and then `npm run dev` to start the development server.

`npm run build` will build the project ready for production.

If deploying via netlify, set the build script as `npm run build` and set the build directory as `dist`.
